In computer science, the dining philosophers problem is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them.



A group of philosophers has decided to start a new theory, dictating a group of rules about sharing natural resources that prevents famishment around the world.
Before the release of those rule, they decided testing it in a simulator. They hired you to carry through this simulator and finally showing the whole world their infinite wisdom.
On your shoulders is a huge responsibility : proving that your new friends have resolved the famishment problem. In order to avoid the stress linked to the amount of risk of this mission.
